# Pen & Paper Wordle
An analogue version of the popular Wordle game

Simply print out the ODT file on paper.

You need: pen, green highlighter, yellow highlighter.

In case someone doesn't know the analogue rules yet:
A correct letter in the right place is highlighted in green in the boxes where you enter the assumed words, a correct letter in the wrong place is highlighted in yellow.
Following the same pattern, all letters that have already been used in words are also marked on the alphabet below the boxes; in addition, letters that do not appear in the searched word are circled.

ODT file created with LibreOffice Writer 7.3.0.3 Windows. So if you need different letters in your language you can easily modify the document.

This is only my second Github project. If I have disregarded any Github standards, I am grateful for hints and help.
