# Pen & Paper Wordle
An analogue version of the popular Wordle game

You need: pen, green highlighter, yellow highlighter.

In case someone doesn't know the analogue rules yet:
A correct letter in the right place is highlighted in green in the boxes where you enter the assumed words, a correct letter in the wrong place is highlighted in yellow.
Following the same pattern, all letters that have already been used in words are also marked on the alphabet below the boxes; in addition, letters that do not appear in the searched word are circled.
